# Introduction
## 1. Background
Fees, information leaks, privacy violations, fraud, and censorship are common issues in our day-to-day use of centralised services. Since the introduction of the bitcoin concept in 2008, many blockchain applications have been created, and developers have been trying to address these issues with blockchain technology [15] .
However, these attempts are rarely successful, either because they are too limited in their scope or because they are constrained by the speed with which transactions are processed. Because of the limitations of flexibility and computing power, it's almost impossible to build complex applications like Facebook and Amazon on blockchains, not to mention more efficient ones like digital asset exchanges.
The problem of capacity expansion comes from the underlying design of the existing blockchain, which can be roughly divided into consensus mechanism and blockchain architecture. Most existing blockchains face two challenges in scaling up.
1) each full node must store the entire book in order to participate in the verification of Transactions;
2) each participating node in the network has an obligation to process each transaction.
Because all nodes in this setting have the same processing and operation in essence, the processing speed of the whole block chain network is limited by the processing speed of a single node. In addition, over time, the amount of space required to store all the information on the blockchain will increase, making it more difficult to participate as a full node, whether in terms of storage space, network speed, or computing power. The increasing cost of mining will inevitably leave the mine in the hands of a few nodes, again bringing us back to the centrality issue.
The XPEERCHAIN is designed to fill this gap. In our vision, XPeerchain is the next-generation blockchain technology that provides the underlying infrastructure for a service-oriented ecosystem. The XPeerchain platform not only provides a completely decentralized way for users to exchange online services and digital goods, but also enables developers to deploy large, decentralized applications to a large number of user groups. Through a number of groundbreaking innovations, such as efficient distributed fragmentation ("EDS") and the principle of "Believable-first" , it is possible to significantly increase system throughput while ensuring security.
EDS is developed based on the design concept of Sharding (Sharding) in distributed system. The concept of sharding is widely used in distributed systems and databases to support parallel transaction processing. Inspired by the classic "Divide and rule" principle in computer science, EDS divides the entire XPeerchain network into several sub-spaces called Shard (shards) . We can think of each shard as a micro-network running its own consensus protocols in parallel. Unlike traditional blockchain technology, which allows the whole network to verify the same set of transactions, each sub-network fragment under EDS will form a consensus group and conduct transaction verification simultaneously. As a result, the throughput of the system can be significantly improved even as the network size and number of transactions grow rapidly. Moreover, in order to ensure the uniform partition of the network, we develop a distributed randomicity generation protocol with high tolerance to introduce unbiased and transparent randomicity into the partitioning process.
In addition to EDS, XPeerchain includes a number of other innovative technologies to support large-scale deployment of dapps with high performance and flexibility. It allows developers to develop a wide range of products, from traditional, monopolistic alternatives to online service providers, to entirely new business models that were previously thought impossible.
## 2. The Token economy has arrived
By February 2019, blockchain technology had been around for more than a decade. Despite its evolution over this period, a central question remains: is blockchain technology really an innovation that creates value for the global economy?
Let's look at the current data, and the assets managed by the blockchain (called "assets on the chain") are basically, various tokens or digital currencies, with a total market value of about $150 billion. These assets on the chain are generally characterized by high volatility, strong speculative nature and difficult to benefit the world economy. In fact, starting with Satoshi Nakamoto, people have been trying to make these tokens into a form of payment currency, but so far they have been used primarily as digital money rather than as traditional money. Digital money is not so much a function of money as a symbol.
On the one hand, the issue of money is a political realization, monetary power must belong to the state. As a result, cryptocurrencies are hard to replace legal tender. Without the authorization and support of the state, the so-called "digital currency" is only an idealistic pursuit.
On the other hand, most of the global mainstream assets (tangible and intangible) are not on the blockchain (called "out-of-chain") and the interaction between the blockchain and out-of-chain assets is limited.
So, the pass can only be digital currency? OF COURSE NOT! The basic meaning of a pass is "symbol, symbol" , but it should be regarded as a voucher rather than a digital currency. These vouchers can represent a variety of rights and interests, including shopping points, coupons, ID cards, diplomas, real estate, passes, event tickets and various rights and benefits. Looking back on the history, the proof of rights and interests is an important part of every civilization of human society. Accounts, ownership, qualifications, certificates, and so on are all representatives of equity. As Juvall put it in a brief history of mankind, "It is these 'invented facts' that are at the heart of what makes the wise man stand out and build civilization. " If these claims prove to be true and complete with digital, electronic and cryptographic safeguards, then human civilization will be revolutionized. We call it the Token Economy.
Running a pass on the blockchain provides a solid foundation of trust and traceability that no traditional hub-and-spoke infrastructure can provide. Therefore, if the pass is the front-end Economic Unit of the pass economy, then the block-chain is the back-end technology of the pass economy.


Admittedly, running such services can be quite expensive when the XPeerchain network is relatively small. However, as the number of nodes and resources in the network increases, the cost of running such large-scale DApps will be greatly reduced. In addition, XPeerchain provides a number of benefits, including avoiding network attacks, high-level data security, and immutable properties.
In developing the XPEERCHAIN blockchain, we thoroughly examined all currently available blockchain solutions to learn from previous attempts.


Xpeerchain is a block chain network independent of Peercoin and will be a competitor to Peercoin. The announcement was made as early as June 2019 and led by Scoot Nadal, a longtime supporter of Peercoin. Nadal said in a press release that he will use Xpeerchain to build a more up to date blockchain network, further optimize PoS equity proof, and build a cross chain, intelligent contract blockchain network model. Anyone can easily publish their own blockchain network through the Xpeerchain, which will have the same mechanism as the XPEERCHAIN and deliver value in parallel with the XPEERCHAIN's other chains.
# Related Research
## 1. BITCOIN and proof-of-work system
Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to solve the problem of building consensus in an unlicensed environment, where any node is free to join and leave the network, for example, without requiring the system to have prior knowledge of the consensus node. In a bitcoin network, blockchains provide financial incentives to servers, known as miners, to scale up distributed systems without human intervention. The miners in the bitcoin network came to an agreement by calculating the Hasche Collisions, parts of which had a certain difficulty level. The chain with the greatest cumulative difficulty will be accepted as the consensus result by other nodes. The solution, called proof-of-work system, essentially asks all the nodes in the network to contribute their computing power in order to gain an incentive to prioritize transactions across the system POW has the advantage of being able to defend itself against witch attacks without permission [15] . While bitcoin has some advantages in terms of size and security, it still has some major drawbacks:
1) unlike other modern cryptocurrencies, it takes more than an hour to confirm a transaction;
2) it's hard to develop applications on the BITCOIN network;
3) the consensus mechanism wastes too many resources, according to research showing that bitcoin networks spend more than $2 million a day on electricity.
What's more, earlier research has shown that block chains of the same type as bitcoins must have sufficiently large time intervals to be secure [16][17] . As a result, bitcoin will not be a good alternative to the current centralized system that supports day to day applications and large transactions.
## 2. Proof of equity
The concept of proof of interest was first proposed in an online blockchain forum and adopted by Peercoin Pos essentially means that each equity holder of a unit has one vote, so for each verifier, having more equity will have a higher vote. Therefore, the verifier has no economic incentive to harm the entire blockchain network. For an attacker, the cost of an attack is huge, because they must own the majority of the equity. In the early development, it has been found that the equity proof consensus mechanism is vulnerable to the "Nothing-at-Stake" attack. Since there is no incentive / penalty for the server / node in the network to vote to validate the block, the node will vote for multiple blocks at the same time in order to maximize the benefit, without any incentive to converge The security of the blockchain was compromised. In later studies, the Slasher Algorithm solved this problem by imposing penalties on the offending nodes. Many other items are also classified as proof of interest applications. Although PoS achieves the activity of replication state machine protocol, it still faces the challenges of Centralization and security. For example, verifiers with more tokens are more likely to pack up new blocks and be rewarded with more tokens, leading to potential centralization issues. In addition, previous research has shown that VCA can be a provably secure and configured strong conformance protocol only if the transaction of tokens is infrequent, which may mean that, for security purposes, proof-of-interest consensus protocols have a maximum throughput.
## 3. State machine replication
In short, blockchain is a state machine replication protocol. Each state machine replication protocol must satisfy two important properties:
1. *Security, that is, all servers in the network have the same transaction record;*
2. *Activity, that is, customer transactions are quickly submitted and logged.*

There are two fundamentally different ways to implement state machine replication: classical consensus and blockchain consensus [18] . Classical consensus usually uses a consensus algorithm similar to Paxos and is used in a permission environment with prior knowledge about the consensus node. A good example is the servers of software companies like Amazon, whose servers collectively copy and store information in the classic ways that classical algorithms establish basic principles to form a common understanding of how data is sorted.
# 3. blockchain architecture
The structure of Xpeerchain blockchain is similar to the existing well-known blockchain, such as Bitcoin and ether house, the nodes propagate data through Gossip protocol. The system splits the data and state into different slices. Each node in the system will be contained in a Shard. UNUSED transactions (UTXO) are stored in the memory of the corresponding shard node. This creates several new challenges.
* How to slice the system.
* How to agree on each shard.
* How to execute transactions between shards.

In order to solve the above problems fairly and safely, we must perform many random operations. For example, assign nodes to shards and select the lead node in each shard. Therefore, we must first design an unforgeable, unbiased (uniform random) distributed random number generation protocol. By using random number generation protocol, the above problems can be solved one by one.
In the remainder of this article, we will introduce the techniques and methods used to address these challenges.
* In Chapter 4, we'll explore in detail the Distributed Randomness Protocol (DRP) , which is unforgeable and unbiased when the percentage of malicious nodes is below a predetermined threshold. The random numbers generated by the DRP are used to slice the system, assign nodes to different shards, and select the lead node in each shard.
* In Chapter 5, we demonstrate Atomix -- a novel two-step shard-to-shard Atomic Commit Protocol that guarantees transactional atomicity in Byzantine settings.
* In Chapter 6, we introduce the microblock (MSB)-a novel mechanism that minimizes the storage and entry costs of validation nodes.
* In Chapter 7, we introduce the confidence proof (POB)-A pioneering Byzantine consensus protocol, which adopts the confidence-first principle to guarantee the security and activity of the system At the same time, it greatly improves the consensus mechanism of transaction throughput in slicing.
# Distributed randomicity protocol
Traditional methods for generating randomness, such as the proof-of-work system mechanism [13] or the trusted Beacon [6] , have computational waste and centralization problems. Using cryptography tools to generate distributed random numbers can not only save resources, but also ensure data security.
The random number is used to ensure the fairness in the node slice allocation and the leader node election in the XPeerchain block chain. At present, there are many algorithms to generate random numbers in distributed systems. Here we introduce an algorithm that best fits the requirements of the XPEERCHAIN blockchain scenario. In the XPEERCHAIN blockchain, generators of distributed random numbers have the following requirements:
1. Dishonest Actors (both client and server) must be resisted in proportion. In detail, when the percentage of dishonest participants falls below a certain number, the system can continue to function without any ill effects.
2. In addition to negligible probabilities, the final random number must be unforgeable and unbiased (uniformly random) .
3. Dishonest participants can not repeatedly attempt to generate random numbers in their favor, even in the case of collusion among multiple dishonest participants.
4. A third party can verify that the output is produced by an honest operating protocol (that is, that it meets all of the above requirements) .

To meet these requirements, WE PROPOSE A CLIENT-SERVER PROTOCOL called distributed random protocol (DRP)[24]  The client communicates with a group of servers via non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZK) and publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) to produce an unforgeable, uniformly distributed random value. When the protocol runs, no participant in the protocol has access to any information about the final output until the protocol is complete and the final random number is displayed This ensures that the dishonest client can not attempt to generate random numbers multiple times in favor of a more favorable random number.
The protocol consists of two phases-random number generation and random number verification. In simple terms, it works like this: initially, the client starts the protocol by broadcasting messages, including randomly generated balanced packets, to all servers. In the first phase, each server generates a random input value and only uses PVSS to create a "shared vote" for other members of the same group. After receiving a NIZK [25] proof of the encryption sharing vote from all servers or after the server timed out, the client selects a portion of the server's input from each group. This allows the client to pin the key of each group and the output of the protocol. In the second phase, once the client receives the global collective signature (COSI) for the input, the server decrypts it and sends its shared vote to the client [25] . The client then merges the keys of the recovered group to display the final random output.
# 5. Slice trading
Mechanisms to support transactions between shards are critical in our system because transactions are likely to occur on multiple shards. We introduced the Byzantine shard atomic commit (Atomix) protocol to ensure atomicity between shards. The agreement prevents double spending and maintains consistency in transactions. Our design is a variant of the Omniledger algorithm [8]
Atomix is first proposed in the UTXO state model. Previous literature and research have shown that by supporting the UTXO model, Atomix can ensure that our shard trading mechanism also supports smart contracts [27] .
In short, when a transaction passes through both the a Shard of node a and the B Shard of Node B, the Algorithm does the following:
1. Create the transaction TX in Shard A and have all nodes validate the transaction.
2. If the transaction TX is approved by all nodes in Shard a, the transaction is recorded in a's blockchain. At the same time, the client will gossip a proof of acceptance to authenticate the transaction, lock a's money into a UTXO, and send it to B.
* If the transaction TX is rejected by node a, the money is returned to A.
1. The blockchain of a submits the transaction TX to the blockchain of B and verifies the transaction TX at the node in the required recipient slice.
* If the transaction TX is rejected by the node in B, the money is returned to A.
1. If the transaction TX is approved by all nodes in B's Blockchain, the funds are released to B.
* If TX is rejected by all nodes, the funding will be returned to A.
# Memory Pruning Algorithm for blockchain
Another problem currently facing the blockchain is the rapid expansion of the size of the blockchain storage [8] , which creates a heavy workload for new verifiers. Blockchains have been following the same pattern for storing historical data. However, this is a critical issue for high throughput blockchain systems, as storage requirements will grow rapidly. In order to minimize the storage and cold-start costs of validators, we use the block chain store pruning algorithm to compress the complete state of the partitioned blockchain. We use State Block [8] based mini State blocks (MSB) . We describe the MSB generation protocol below.
# VII. consensus-building mechanism
## 1. Tokens and motives
In the XPeerchain system, Xpeerchain Tokens, like those in other blockchain systems, are used as a carrier of value for all transactions and as a commission to pay for the use of resources. More importantly, XPeerchain tokens can also be used as a variable to calculate a user's credibility score. All XPeerchain tokens will be generated in the Genesis Block. In the XPeerchain ecosystem, XPeerchain tokens can be used for:
* PAYMENT: Payment for services and goods provided by merchants or other members of the community.
* COMMISSIONS: Payments to nodes for running smart contracts, processing messages and transactions, and using common ecosystem shared resources (including but not limited to storage, computing power, and so on) . Commission can motivate verifiers and prevent malicious users from over-deploying smart contracts to the detriment of the community.
* Credibility: The XPeerchain token will be used to calculate the user's credibility (explained in the next section) .

In addition, as a member of the XPeerchain ecosystem, each user can obtain XPeerchain tokens by validating transactions and contributing resources, such as running smart contracts, providing storage space, and so on.
As mentioned in the previous section, a major challenge for traditional equity proof consensus mechanisms is the trend towards centralization. To mitigate this risk, we introduced Servi as a measure of user contributions to the community and encouraged members to contribute to the continued development of the Xpeerchain blockchain. It has the following properties:
* Non-tradable: as Servi is not a medium of exchange, Servi can not trade or exchange in any way.
* Self-destruction: After block validation, the system will automatically clear the VALIDATOR's Servi balance, making the trusted nodes take turns to validate the block, thus ensuring a fair block generation process.
* SELF-DISTRIBUTION: Servi is automatically generated and deposited into the user account after certain contributions, such as providing community services, evaluating services provided by the other party, or making other special contributions.

## 2. Research on credibility proof
Depending on the Shard size, blockchain systems have a natural tradeoff between security and throughput. A system with a large number of small shards (including a small number of nodes) provides better performance, but is less resistant to malicious nodes, and vice versa. To ensure both security and throughput, we propose an innovative PoB consensus protocol for the Xpeerchain blockchain The PoB guarantees that there is little chance of malicious behavior and significantly improves transaction throughput through one-size-shards.
The creditability proof consensus protocol uses the Believable-First method. The protocol divides all validators into two groups, a highly trusted group and a normal group. Highly trusted verifiers fast-track transactions in the first phase. Then, in the second phase, the ordinary verifiers sample and validate these transactions to provide the final result and ensure verifiability. The probability of nodes being selected into high trusted groups is determined by the reliability score, which is calculated by many factors, such as: The balance of Tokens, the contribution to the community, the network behavior, etc. . An individual with a high confidence score is more likely to be selected for the High Confidence Score. The trusted verifier follows procedures to determine the transactions to be authenticated and the order in which they will be processed. Trusted verifiers can also form smaller groups-one verifier per group. Transactions will be randomly assigned to these trusted verifiers. As a result, they produce smaller blocks with very low latency.
However, in this case, there is a potential security risk because only one node is performing validation. Therefore, some malicious transactions may be committed by malicious verifiers. To solve this security problem, we specify a sampling probability P, that is, the normal verifier will sample the transaction and detect its inconsistency. If the verifier is detected as misconduct, all tokens and reputation in the system will be lost, and the fraudulent user will be compensated. The confidence-first approach makes processing transactions very fast, because only one (trusted) verifier is doing the validation, and with the right parameters set, the likelihood of misconduct is very low.
In the XPeerchain system, the SHARD policy file specifies the size of the high-trust and normal packets and the sampling probability p. At the beginning of each epoch, all validators will be allocated to different shards through a distributed random generation protocol. Their state is booted from the last microstate block (MSB) of the corresponding shard. Depending on the reliability score, the verifier will be assigned to either a highly trusted group (with fewer nodes) or a normal group (with more nodes) within the Shard.
In the first phase, verified blocks are generated from transactions processed by highly trusted packets. These blocks are re-validated as input for a sample of common packets that are running concurrently. The General Federation also combines input from multiple processing groups. This maximizes the throughput of the system. If transactions are successfully validated, they are included in completed blocks, added to the fragmented Blockchain, and eventually included in MSB. However, when any inconsistency is detected by the normal packet, the corresponding authentication transaction will be excluded from the blockchain, and the verifier of the invalid signature block will be detected and held accountable. We designed the punishment to be very rigorous so that the witness would not have any motive for misconduct under any circumstances. If the verifier is detected as behaving improperly, the verifier will lose all tokens and credits in the system and will re-examine all transactions previously verified. Given minimal malicious incentives and the confidence to verify the security of the system in a quantifiable way, customers can handle it in real time at any time.
The run of common groupings is based on the Byzantine consensus strategy of Byzcoin [7] because it can be effectively extended to thousands of consensus team members Byzcoin uses a set signature (COSI)[25] , an extensible cryptographic primitive [20] that uses multiple signatures to create traditional consensus algorithms, such as PBFT [4]  BYZCOIN uses multicast trees to distribute blocks to improve performance, and backtracks to a star topology for fault tolerance. It ensures that all honest members of the Shard can reach a specific common sequence of operations even if there are some malicious nodes in the Shard, and at the same time ensures system security and activity.
In order to ensure the stability, we use the alternatives in the confidence-limited protocol. When a Shard does not have enough trusted validators to form a highly trusted group, whether due to a temporary outage or a cold start in an ecosystem, the two-part certification committee becomes a one-step grouping That is, all transactions are handled directly by the general packet according to the PBFT consensus agreement.
## 3. Consensus Algorithm
Xpeerchain uses BFT-DPOS as its consensus algorithm. DPOS has been proved to be able to meet the requirements of blockchain applications. Under this algorithm, all holders of XPC can select the production block node through a continuous voting system. Anyone can participate in block production as long as he can persuade the permit holder to vote for him.
Xpeerchain generates blocks every 0.5 s, and only one producer is authorized to produce blocks at any one time. If the block is not produced on time, blocks for that time period are skipped. When one or more blocks are skipped, there may be a gap of 0.5 seconds or more on the block chain.
The outgoing block node of the XPeerchain public chain is dynamic. In the beginning we set it to 15 outbound nodes. This figure will then be determined by the Governance Committee on the decentralization chain. For convenience, we assume the use of 15 out-of-block nodes in this white paper.
In an XPEERCHAIN system, every 180 blocks is a wheel (each block generates 12, with 15 outgoing block nodes) . At the beginning of each round, 15 unique outgoing blocks are voted out by XPC pass holders. The selected outgoing blocks are executed in the order agreed by the 11 or more outgoing block nodes.
If an outblock node misses a block and has not produced any blocks in the last 24 hours, it is removed from the producer until it expresses its desire to outblock again to the blockchain. The smooth running of the network is ensured by minimizing the number of blocks leaking out of the unreliable block nodes.
The Byzantine fault-tolerant Algorithm allows all outgoing block nodes to sign all blocks, as long as no outgoing block nodes are used to sign two different blocks with the same timestamp or block height. Once more than 11 out-of-block nodes are signed, a block is validated and irreversible. Any Byzantine outblock node that signs two phases, a timestamped block or a block of the same height, will be cryptographically evidence of their wrongdoing.
## 4. Bonus design
Dividend mechanism is a new PoS mechanism upgraded in Xpeerchain. This is a powerful, flexible, and convenient mechanism that can be combined with existing functions. Its main purpose is to distribute profits to stakeholders or shareholders under a set of rules. Two types of dividends are now supported, passive and active, depending on how they are earned.
Passive dividend is that DAPP can use according to the community operating status through the contract of specific user behavior for air dividend.
Active dividend means that XPC holders can participate in the dividend model by voting, and the revenue of nodes is calculated according to the system dividend rules, the number of XPC votes, and the proportion of XPC votes Distribute a portion of the proceeds to the voters.
# 8. SMART contracts
A smart contract is a set of promises, defined in digital form, that includes agreements on which participants can enforce those promises. In physics, the carrier of the intelligent contract is the computer code that the computer can recognize and run. Bitcoin scripting language is an imperative, stack-based programming language, because it is non-turing complete, so the application has certain limitations. ETHEREUM was the first blockchain system in the world to implement turing's complete smart contract. The programming language was Solidity and Serpent, which enabled application developers to develop a wide variety of applications efficiently and quickly. After the Smart Contract Code is published on the blockchain, it is automatically executed on the blockchain without the mediation The smart contract programming language in Xpeerchain will use the world's hottest Java as the contract language, and we'll be rolling out support for a variety of programming languages that will allow developers to program in their favorite high level languages Examples are Python, Go, JavaScript, Scala, and so on.
XPEERCHAIN will support Turing's complete smart contracts, enabling the blockchain network to run richer, more contextual ecological applications;
# 9. Multiple signatures
The authorization operation of XPeerchain mainly includes multi-signature, weight calculation, threshold setting and so on. Since each pass is independent of each other, the transfer of the pass can be performed in parallel. In addition, because the permissions for each group are independent of each other, it is possible to perform publishing and management operations in parallel between different groups.
